# Hangman-Game
Simple Hangman Game
This app takes the traditional children's word game and adapts it into a quiz about the state capitals of the US states.
The player is presented onscreen with a row of blanks representing the letters of a state capital.
In an aside, the player is presented with an image of the flag of the state for which the city is the capital.
By touching keys, the player selects letters to fill the blanks.
Correct letter guesses are filled in the blanks onscreen.
Incorrect letter guesses are listed onscreen in an "incorrect letter guesses" area.
A player is given the traditional nine incorrect letter guesses before he/she loses.  (The number of nine relates to the number of strokes used to construct a traditional "hanged" human figure.)
A player wins by filling in all the onscreen blanks with the correct letters, thereby revealing the state capital's name.
If a player wins, he/she is rewarded with a short descriptive phrase about the capital.
When a game ends, win or lose, the player is automatically presented with a new game.
In any one series of games, the number of the player's wins is kept track of and displayed on the screen.
The number of the player's losses is NOT kept track of and displayed onscreen.  After all, it's only a game and we're just trying to have fun.
